# Omaze Entry Purchase Flow - Playwright Tests

This repository contains comprehensive Playwright tests for the Omaze UK entry purchase flow, built specifically for mobile Safari testing (iPhone 15 Pro Max configuration).

## Overview

The test suite follows the requirements from `generate_tests.prompt.md` and implements comprehensive testing for the Omaze entry purchase functionality, including:

- **Entry Purchase Flow Testing**: Complete end-to-end testing from homepage to checkout
- **Accessibility Testing**: ARIA compliance, keyboard navigation, and mobile accessibility
- **Network & Data Layer Testing**: Performance monitoring, API calls, and analytics tracking
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Optimized for iPhone 15 Pro Max Safari testing

## Test Structure

### Core Test Files

- **Mobile Viewport**: iPhone 15 Pro Max configuration
- **Error Handling**: Robust locator strategies with fallbacks
- **Force Clicks**: Handles overlapping elements gracefully

## Running Tests

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Run core tests - fastest validation
npx playwright test tests/core-entry-process.spec.ts --headed

# Run specific test category
npx playwright test tests/entry-purchase-flow.spec.ts --headed
npx playwright test tests/accessibility.spec.ts --headed
npx playwright test tests/network-data.spec.ts --headed
```

### Full Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests
npx playwright test --headed

# Run tests in headless mode
npx playwright test

# Generate and view HTML report
npx playwright test
npx playwright show-report
```

### Individual Test Execution
```bash
# Run a specific test
npx playwright test tests/entry-purchase-flow.spec.ts:17 --headed

# Debug mode with inspector
npx playwright test tests/core-entry-process.spec.ts --debug
```

## Configuration

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)
- **Base URL**: `https://omaze.co.uk`
- **Device**: iPhone 15 Pro Max
- **Browser**: Mobile Safari (WebKit)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per test
- **Retries**: 1 retry on CI, 0 locally

### Test Annotations
All tests include detailed annotations:
```typescript
test.info().annotations.push({
  type: 'feature|accessibility|performance|mobile',
  description: 'Detailed description of test purpose'
});
```

## Test Scenarios Covered

### Entry Purchase Flow
âœ… Complete single purchase flow (homepage â†’ checkout)  
âœ… Cart quantity modification and item removal  
âœ… Checkout form validation and error handling  
âœ… Mobile navigation and responsiveness  
âœ… Entry method verification (Single/Subscription/Postal)  
âœ… Customer information form completion  
âœ… Express checkout options validation  
âœ… Terms and conditions link verification  

### Accessibility Compliance
âœ… Homepage accessibility checks  
âœ… Entry page keyboard navigation  
âœ… Cart accessibility features  
âœ… Checkout form ARIA labels  
âœ… Mobile touch accessibility (44x44px targets)  
âœ… Color contrast and visual accessibility  
âœ… Screen reader announcements  
âœ… Focus management and tab order  

### Network & Performance
âœ… Page load performance monitoring  
âœ… Data layer events tracking  
âœ… API calls during checkout process  
âœ… Third-party integrations verification  
âœ… Form submission network calls  
âœ… Mobile performance optimization  

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Cookie Consent Banner
**Issue**: OneTrust cookie banner blocks interactions  
**Solution**: Automatic banner dismissal implemented in `OmazePage.handleCookieConsent()`

### Strict Mode Violations
**Issue**: Multiple elements with same text/locator  
**Solution**: Use `.first()` or more specific selectors

### Mobile Touch Targets
**Issue**: Some elements may be smaller than 44x44px  
**Solution**: Touch target size validation in accessibility tests

## Expected Test Results

### Successful Test Run
- **Entry Purchase Flow**: All scenarios should pass
- **Accessibility**: ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation verified
- **Network**: Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- **Mobile**: Touch targets and responsive design validated

### Typical Performance Metrics
- Page load time: < 5 seconds
- Total requests: < 100 per flow
- Data transfer: < 10MB for mobile experience
- API response times: < 2 seconds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Cookie Banner Timeout**: Increase timeout in `handleCookieConsent()`
2. **Element Not Found**: Verify selectors against current page structure
3. **Network Timeout**: Check internet connection and site availability
4. **Mobile Viewport Issues**: Ensure iPhone 15 Pro Max config is correct

### Debug Tools
```bash
# Run with trace for detailed debugging
npx playwright test --trace on

# Generate screenshot on failure
npx playwright test --screenshot only-on-failure
```

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Follow the Page Object Model pattern
2. Include test annotations for categorization
3. Handle cookie consent in page interactions
4. Use mobile-appropriate assertions
5. Add performance/accessibility checks where relevant
